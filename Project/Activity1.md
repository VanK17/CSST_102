# Healthcare - Disease Diagnosis and Analytics 

### Problem 
**Problem being Addressed:** The speed on how the cancer and diseases can be detected as early as possible, for higher chance of survival with high accuracy.


### Machine Learning Approach
**Supervised Learning:** Use of Medical Anlysis Systems, modern equipments. 
**Possible Unsepervised Learning:** Clustering technique to Identify patterns in Medical data such as discovering new type of diseases

### Impact
**Patient Outcome:** Enhanced diagnosis on patient that have a possible symptomps for this disease, leading for more patient care and right treatment.

### Challenge
**Main Problem:** Ensuring the patients data and privacy, handling patients sensitive information.

###Solution
**Decentralized Learning Approach:** Allows the system not to share raw data of the patients records, protecting their privacy. 


# Finance - Real-Time Fraud Detection

### Problem

**Problem being Addressed:** The increasing risk of attacks or fraudalent activities that required necessity for immediate detection, protection and detection.

### Machine Learning Approach
**Unsupervised Learning:** Anomaly detection using cluster algorithms. 
**Possible Supervised Learning:** After detecting the possible Anomality on the system, supervised learning can be used to classify, and protect different transactions.

### Impact
**Users Outcome:** Enhanced security and safe transactions that may boost their trust.

### Challenge
**Main Problem:** High numbers of false positives transactions may result in legitimate transactions being mistakenly flagged as fraudulent and making transactions more vulnerable.

###Solution
**Hybrid Learning Approach:** Enhanced supervised learning to refine anomaly detection accuracy, reducing false possitive transactions.
