# Healthcare - Disease Diagnosis and Analytics 

### Problem 
**Problem being Addressed:** The speed on how the cancer and diseases can be detected as early as possible, for higher chance of survival with high accuracy.


### Machine Learning Approach
**Supervised Learning:** Use of Medical Anlysis Systems, modern equipments. 
**Possible Unsepervised Learning:** Clustering technique to Identify patterns in Medical data such as discovering new type of diseases

### Impact
**Patient Outcome:** Enhanced diagnosis on patient that have a possible symptomps for this disease, leading for more patient care and right treatment.

### Challenge
**Main Problem:** Ensuring the patients data and privacy, handling patients sensitive information.

###Solution
**Decentralized Learning Approach:** Allows the system not to share raw data of the patients records, protecting their privacy. 


# Finance - Real-Time Fraud Detection

### Problem

**Problem being Addressed:** The increasing risk of attacks or fraudalent activities that required necessity for immediate detection, protection and detection.

### Machine Learning Approach
**Unsupervised Learning:** Anomaly detection using cluster algorithms. 
**Possible Supervised Learning:** After detecting the possible Anomality on the system, supervised learning can be used to classify, and protect different transactions.

### Impact
**Users Outcome:** Enhanced security and safe transactions that may boost their trust.

### Challenge
**Main Problem:** High numbers of false positives transactions may result in legitimate transactions being mistakenly flagged as fraudulent and making transactions more vulnerable.

### Solution
**Hybrid Learning Approach:** Enhanced supervised learning to refine anomaly detection accuracy, reducing false possitive transactions. 


# Autonomous Systems - Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)

### Problem

**Problem being Addressed:** For autonomus navigation in complex and unpredicatble environment 

### Machine Learning Approach
**Reinforcement Learning:** Real-time decision-making in the driving environments with deep reinforcement learning.
**Possible Supervised Learning:** There's also potential to use unsupervised learning to identify trends in driving behavior and environmental attributes, which could enhance the navigation systems and decision-making power of an autonomous system when crunching through unfamiliar scenarios.

### Impact
**Road Safety:**  Improved road safety, reduced traffic accidents, and potential transformation of urban mobility.

### Challenge
**Main Problem:** Ensuring real-time decisions are correct â€” especially in edge cases where the unexpected happens.

### Solution
**Hybrid Learning Approach:**  It unifies the reinforcement learning with rule-based system to make safe and precise decisions.

# Summary

**Executive Summary:** ML is leading innovation in healthcare, finance and self-driving systems. Every application uses a different learning paradigms and has the potential of using unsupervised learning as well for more profound insights. Anyhow, as these technologies solve some important issues they do bring in challenges and so the need of a design thinking.

**Future Directions:** Support further investigation for unattended acquisition to bring novel prospects in the integration and resolution of existing issues.
